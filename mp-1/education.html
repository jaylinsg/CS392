                        Here you can see my full education history. Typically on a resume 
                        an employer is concerned with the high school or college, but
                        on this site you can go deeper into my history as a student. Below I list
                        each school I attended since elementary school, with a description of my 
                        time there and its impact on my life.

                    <h3>PS 41 (The Stephanie A. Vierno School)</h3>
                    <h4>Elementary School</h4>
                    <p>
                        I attended PS 41 from kindergarten through fifth grade—years that shaped who I am today, even if some details have faded. 
                        Many of the friendships I made there still endure. The highlight of my time was serving as school president in fifth grade: 
                        to campaign, I performed a rap outlining my vision for the school—and it won me the election! One change I implemented 
                        has become a lasting tradition. On rainy days, when recess moved indoors, I transformed the cafeteria into an open-mic stage, 
                        inviting students to perform songs, poems, or any talent they had. That experience taught me the power of creativity 
                        and leadership values which I carry with me in every new role I take on.
