        <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up on Staten Island, New York—just a short ferry ride from Manhattan.
          I love that I can escape to the city whenever I crave its energy, then come home
          to the quieter pace of the island.

          <h2>Sports & Gaming</h2>
          <p>
            Basketball has been a passion of mine since middle school—playing pick-up games,
            cheering on the Knicks, and even jumping into NBA 2K on the weekends. I'm also a
            lifelong gamer and fascinated by how games are built, from the art assets to the
            game engines under the hood.

          <p>
            I'm a dedicated anime fan (currently caught up on <em>One Piece</em> and always
            hunting for the next great series). At home, I've got two dogs who keep life
            playful—they're my daily reminder to take breaks and enjoy the little things.

          <h2>Family & Background</h2>
          <p>
            I was raised by my mom here on Staten Island, while my dad lives in the city.
            Though our family doesn't lean heavily on cultural traditions, I've grown up
            balancing their different perspectives. I also have three siblings—one older
            brother, an older sister, and a younger sister—so the house was always lively.
