            Many, many, many years ago, I began working. So long in fact, 
            that when I recieved my first position the minimum 
            wage was still $8/hour. It is now $15/hour! Here are 
            the diverse work experiences I have had since 2016.  
        </p>

        <h3>NYC Parks</h3>
        <h4>2016-2017</h4>
        <p>
          I spent two summers at Miller Field helping NYC Parks remove invasive phragmites and keep the beach spotless.
          Uprooting those tall reeds took patience and teamwork, and I loved doing my part to protect our local shoreline.
        </p>

        <h3>UAU</h3>
        <h4>2017-2019</h4>
        <p>
          While juggling my classes, I supported the UAU office with everyday assistant tasks—answering phones, organizing files,
          and even designing ID cards for summer youth employees. It was my first real taste of balancing work and school,
          and I sharpened my time-management and basic graphic-design skills.

        <h3>Louie G</h3>
        <h4>2017-2020</h4>
        <p>
          As often the only person in the shop, I served up Italian ices, handled cash transactions, and ran both opening and closing shifts.
          That responsibility taught me independence, customer service, and the importance of accuracy when managing money.
        </p>

        <h3>International STEM</h3>
        <h4>2020-2021</h4>
        <p>
          With ISEA, a nonprofit STEAM organization, I prepared and taught Python lessons to middle schoolers from around the world.
          Crafting clear, engaging virtual lessons honed my ability to explain code simply and keep students motivated online.
        </p>

        <h3>MIT Rec</h3>
        <h4>2021-2023</h4>
        <p>
          At MIT's Zesiger Sports & Recreation Center, I greeted members, managed accounts using Club Automation software,
          and handled front-desk inquiries in person and by phone. This role sharpened my customer-service skills and gave
          me hands-on experience with membership-management tools.
        </p>

        <h3>NYSC</h3>
        <h4>2023-2024</h4>
        <p>
          At NYSC Allston (now Crunch Fitness), I managed member accounts via ABC Fitness software and drove new sign-ups
          using the Ignite Sales platform. I balanced daily front-desk duties with membership promotions, boosting both
          my sales techniques and software proficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>Eastern Bank</h3>
        <h4>2023-2024</h4>
        <p>
          Balancing school and another job, I processed deposits, withdrawals, and check cashing at Eastern Bank.
          I promoted bank services, communicated daily with customers, and maintained meticulous accuracy—
          an experience that sparked my interest in financial technology.
